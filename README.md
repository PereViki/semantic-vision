# Semantic Vision Workshop
### Overview

### Installation
All the examples are using [p5js](http://p5js.org/) for displaying graphics and creating interactive sketches. The [ml5js](https://ml5js.org/) library is used for computing tasks related to machine learning (object detection, classification, pose estimation, etc). 

### Folder Structure
Each example includes media files where needed. The 'libs' folder contains the necessary js libraries and the pre-trained models.
