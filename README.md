# Semantic Vision Workshop
### Overview
Introduction to creative coding & semantic computer vision using modern web based technologies. Computer vision is with us since many years. Reading and tracking light, pixels, blobs, edges, colors are common techniques in interactive environments. However, the field is just shifting to next level states with successful learning systems (machine learning and deep neural networks) recently. Semantic content became available to deal with, thanks for the extended databases and training algorithms out there. Our machines now understand drawings, objects, human poses, gestures, and many other semantically meaningful components, that are related to vision. This workshop covers some basic methods on how to use these advances, also, it is intended to find novel ways of semantic interaction modalities based on these tools. 

### Installation
All the examples are using [p5js](http://p5js.org/) for displaying graphics and creating interactive sketches. The [ml5js](https://ml5js.org/) library is used for computing tasks related to machine learning (object detection, classification, pose estimation, etc). 

### Folder Structure
Each example includes media files where needed. The 'libs' folder contains the necessary js libraries and the pre-trained models.
